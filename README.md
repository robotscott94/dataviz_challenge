# dataviz_challenge

This program takes data for experimental tumor treatments on mice and creates various visualizations to interpret the data. Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, scipy and matplotlib are utilized.

- Data is loaded and cleaned, removing any duplicates

- Summary statistics for each drug treatment are calculated

- Graphs that display sex ratio, tumor size by treatment group and the change in tumor size over treatment time for a specific mouse is shown

- A scatter plot illustrates the relationship between mouse weight and tumor size indicates a positive relationship between the two variables

- Regression is done on the weight and tumor size to derive the equation of a line that can be used as a model to make future predictions
